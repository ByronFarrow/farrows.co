      <p>I'm Byron and I'm a father, a husband, an educator, a developer
        and always a student. Although born in Grimsby, in the United Kingdom, I
        have not lived in the UK since the last century. In 1999 I moved to Budapest,
        in 2002 to Colombia and in 2006 to China, where I have lived ever since.</p>
      <p>It was in Colombia that I met my wonderful wife, Lina, and since moving to
        China we have raised two incredible children, Edmund and Iona.</p>
      <p>I graduated in 1995 with a degree in Astrophysics from the University of
        Birmingham and followed it up the next year with a PGCE in Secondary Science
        Education from the same institution. Since then I have worked professionally
        as a Physics and Science teacher both in the UK and internationally. I also
        teach Theory of Knowledge (a philosophical course) and have also worked in
        a variety of admin positions in schools.</p>
      <p>I have long been interested in coding and design and in 2018 I started working
        on a second bacherlor's degree online with the University of the People.</p>
      <p>Early in 2019 I was offered the opportunity to combine ny interests and
        hobbies by collaborating in flight simulation development with ORBX and
        currently hold a development position in their TrueEarth scenery projects.</p>
