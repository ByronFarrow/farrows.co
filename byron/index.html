      <div class="box biography">
        <p>I'm Byron and I'm a father, a husband, an educator, a developer
          and always a student. Although born in Grimsby, in the United Kingdom, I
          have not lived in the UK since the last century. In 1999 I moved to Budapest,
          in 2002 to Colombia and in 2006 to China, where I have lived ever since.
        It was in Colombia that I met my wonderful wife, Lina, and since moving to
          China we have raised two incredible children, Edmund and Iona.
        I graduated in 1995 with a degree in Astrophysics from the University of
          Birmingham and followed it up the next year with a PGCE in Secondary Science
          Education from the same institution. Since then I have worked professionally
          as a Physics and Science teacher both in the UK and internationally. I also
          teach Theory of Knowledge (a philosophical course) and have also worked in
          a variety of admin positions in schools.
        I have long been interested in coding and design and in 2018 I started working
          on a second bacherlor's degree online with the <a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/" target="_blank">University of the
            People</a>.
        Early in 2019 I was offered the opportunity to combine ny interests and
          hobbies by collaborating in flight simulation development with <a href="https://orbxdirect.com/" target="_blank">ORBX</a>
          and I currently hold a development position in their TrueEarth scenery projects.
