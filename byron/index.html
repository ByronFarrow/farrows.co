        <h1>Byron Farrow</h1>
        <p>My educational philosophy is to encourage all students
        to believe that they have the ability to grow and improve, and to use the most
        appropriate and effective tools to enable them to do so.</p>

      <div class="box biography">
        <p>I'm Byron and I'm a father, a husband, an educator, a developer
          and always a student. Although born in Grimsby, in the United Kingdom, I
          have not lived in the UK since the last century. In 1999 I moved to Budapest,
          in 2002 to Colombia and in 2006 to China, where I have lived ever since.
        It was in Colombia that I met my wonderful wife, Lina, and since moving to
          China we have raised two incredible children, Edmund and Iona.
        I graduated in 1995 with a degree in Astrophysics from the University of
          Birmingham and followed it up the next year with a PGCE in Secondary Science
          Education from the same institution. Since then I have worked professionally
          as a Physics and Science teacher both in the UK and internationally. I also
          teach Theory of Knowledge (a philosophical course) and have also worked in
          a variety of admin positions in schools.
        I have long been interested in coding and design and in 2018 I started working
          on a second bacherlor's degree online with the <a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/" target="_blank">University of the
            People</a>.
        Early in 2019 I was offered the opportunity to combine ny interests and
          hobbies by collaborating in flight simulation development with <a href="https://orbxdirect.com/" target="_blank">ORBX</a>
          and I currently hold a development position in their TrueEarth scenery projects.
