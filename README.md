## farrows.co

This repo will support development of my website [farrows.co](http://farrows.co).

There are currently three aims that I have in the development of my site:

1. *Love of learning* - I want to learn how to properly develop websites and code. Possibly as an employable skill, but mostly because I enjoy it.
2. *Self promotion* - obviously related to point 1, but having a branded web presence is something I feel is a definite plus in the work environment
3. *Promote my products* - because I do have some ideas for products. See other repos for more details :sunglasses:

Suggestions for future development:

1. *Video* - A brief introductory video?
2. *Font-Face* - Look to replace Google Fonts with font face for China compatability
